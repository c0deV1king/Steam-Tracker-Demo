The goal for this project is to make a tracking webapp that will showcase your achievements and show you cool stats based on them and your profile. <br>

It makes use of the Steam Web API. <br>

## âœ… Current features:
- Recently played games
- Profile overview
- Recent games screenshots
- A games tab with achievement trackers, with the ability to "load more" games dynamically without a full sync if you choose
- An achievements tab to show all your achievements, including a search bar
  (Requires a full sync to show all your achievements, otherwise it just shows whats available in the games tab)
- A full sync button to sync all your games and achievements<br>

## ðŸ“– Planned features:
- A stats tab that takes your information and displays cool stats based on it (Tab exists but its empty)
- A "play next" feature that suggests what achievements and games to play next
- Steam authentication so users can actually use the app and get their data <br>

## ðŸš€ Future endeavours:
- A leaderboard using a site exlusive points system <br>
